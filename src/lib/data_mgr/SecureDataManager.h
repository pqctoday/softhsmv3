/*****************************************************************************
 SecureDataManager.h

 The secure data manager main class. Every token instance has a secure data
 manager instance member that is used to decrypt and encrypt sensitive object
 attributes such as key material. The secure data manager maintains a key blob
 containing a 256-bit AES key that is used in this decryption and encryption
 process. The key blob itself is encrypted using a PBE derived key that is
 derived from the user PIN and a PBE key that is derived from the SO PIN. It
 is up to the token to enforce access control based on which user is logged
 in; authentication using the SO PIN is required to be able to change the
 user PIN. The master key that is used to decrypt/encrypt sensitive attributes
 is stored in memory under a mask that is changed every time the key is used.

 * Every Token instance owns one SecureDataManager.  It holds a 256-bit AES
 * master key in masked form (XOR'd against a heap-allocated random mask).
 * The master key is wrapped twice — once under a PBKDF2-SHA256 key derived
 * from the SO PIN and once from the User PIN — and stored as opaque blobs that
 * are persisted on-disk with the token.
 *
 * Thread safety: encrypt/decrypt/login/logout are serialised by @c dataMgrMutex.
 * Each operation creates a fresh per-call AES instance so no crypto state is shared.
